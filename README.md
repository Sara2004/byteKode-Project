# Use
The safeSchools “Home” page, (“index.html”), is to be used as a submission form, (reports of bigotry within the school are submitted here, and can be resolved or deleted with the buttons next to the entry). Reports are currently stored in arrays; however, given more time, they would be stored in Excel spreadsheets, for example, through CSV files in Python. The screen-size can be reduced to display the drop-down menu, which allows for mobile-use, making the program more accessible. The “About” page provides a description as to what safeSchools’ purpose is, as well as a blank canvas for users to draw on, to alleviate stress, by focusing on a fun activity. Lastly, the “Sign Up” page allows users to submit their names, for safeSchools to better understand the groups of people being most heavily targeted at school. Names, similarly to reports, would be stored in Excel spreadsheets.
